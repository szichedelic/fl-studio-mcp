## v2.0 Requirements

Requirements for milestone v2.0 Production Pipeline. All shipped.

### Humanization

- [x] **HUM-01**: User can humanize notes with Brownian-walk timing push/pull that creates natural drift patterns
- [x] **HUM-02**: User can apply velocity variation with per-instrument profiles (drums, piano, bass, synths)
- [x] **HUM-03**: User can apply swing/groove (50-75% range) to any note pattern
- [x] **HUM-04**: User can vary note lengths per beat position (legato vs staccato)
- [x] **HUM-05**: User can apply context-aware humanization (tight for fast passages, loose for slow)
- [x] **HUM-06**: User can select named humanization presets ("tight", "loose", "jazz", "lo-fi") with beat-position awareness

### Plugin Control

- [x] **PLUG-01**: User can discover all parameters of any loaded VST plugin by name
- [x] **PLUG-02**: User can get and set any VST parameter by name (not index)
- [x] **PLUG-03**: System maintains shadow state for all parameter changes to work around getParamValue bugs

### Serum 2 Sound Design

- [x] **SER-01**: User can control Serum 2 oscillators, filters, macros, and FX via semantic names
- [x] **SER-02**: System uses fuzzy parameter name matching for resilience across Serum 2 versions
- [x] **SER-03**: User can create sounds from recipes (pad, bass, lead, pluck) that set multiple parameters at once
- [x] **SER-04**: User can browse and load Serum 2 presets

### Audio Rendering

- [x] **REN-01**: User can render patterns to WAV via guided workflow with clear step-by-step instructions
- [x] **REN-02**: System automatically detects rendered WAV files and tracks them for downstream processing

### Sample Manipulation

- [x] **SAM-01**: User can pitch-shift and detune audio samples
- [x] **SAM-02**: User can reverse audio samples
- [x] **SAM-03**: User can time-stretch audio samples
- [x] **SAM-04**: User can layer and mix multiple audio files with stereo detune effects
- [x] **SAM-05**: User can execute full resampling workflow (generate notes -> render -> manipulate -> reload)
